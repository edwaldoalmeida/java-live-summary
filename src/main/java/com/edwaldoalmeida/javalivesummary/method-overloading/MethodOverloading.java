/*
# Method Overloading in Java
    * feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their parameter lists are different
    * It is related to compile-time (or static) polymorphism
    * The key to method overloading is a method's signature.
    * Two methods will be considered different if they have different signatures.
* There are two ways to overload a method:
  - Different Number of Parameters
  - Different Types of Parameters
* Notes:
  - Overloaded methods must change the argument list.
  - Overloaded methods can also change the return type, but merely changing the return type does not constitute method overloading.
  - Methods can be overloaded in the same class or in a subclass.
