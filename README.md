# Java Live Summary

These are my Java summaries organized in a way that I can run them in debug mode and see what's happening in runtime and refresh my memory.

How to use:
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the `java` directory in your preferred IDE
3. Go to the desired area, eg: API fetching (`apifetching` dir)
4. Set breakpoint
5. Run in Debug Mode
